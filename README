TxtFeedback for Android is intended for the staff that's always on the move.
Install TxtFeedback on you android phone and always be connected to what you customers are thinking.

The Android app provides a limited nr of features compared to the web dashboard, focusing on the operational aspects of client support and less on the management perspective.

TxtFeedback for Android is based on the Beem project http://beem-project.com/ .
Using an already existing open source application allows us to keep our development costs low and thus provide the TxtFeedback service at the best price per value ratio.

The TxtFeedback team officially thanks the Beam project team for their effort in developing Beem and for their generosity in offering it as an open source application.
